<h3 id="the-why">The Why</h3>
<p>The shortening career horizon for a significant number of RHEL kernel engineers combined with the steep learning curve for new kernel engineers exposes Red Hat to a potential shortfall in the in-house expertise and upstream influence required to maintain and enhance our products. When the level of kernel expertise falls below the threshold to maintain the reputation of RHEL’s stability, increasing customer dissatisfaction is likely to have a cascading effect that may devastate Red Hat’s bottom line. This program’s primary goal is to increase the number of qualified candidates with solid Linux kernel engineering knowledge while developing a thorough curriculum that aims to reduce the amount of time it takes to onboard, train, and cultivate an effective and competent kernel engineer.</p>
<p>Student experience with computer hardware and Linux software varies greatly at all collegiate, pre-collegiate, and non-collegiate levels. The Raspberry Pi platform provides a low-cost entry point for students to gain exposure to all levels of the core computer science stack. Starting from direct interaction with physical devices and the computer components, we move up through the Linux kernel, its low level user space utilities, command line, and programing interface. By focusing on in-depth knowledge of the fundamentals via immersion in C and the Linux environment, we de-mystify the many abstractions students must master to develop the comprehensive mental model of the inner workings of a computer that is so critical for the advanced software engineering that is the powerhouse of this company. Our program aims to provide an entry point to this skill-tree of core computer science concepts at every level of experience, including experienced high-level engineers as well as students who grew up without access to a computer.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Fedora Linux distribution lacks comprehensive support for the Raspberry Pi platform. As part of the student’s journey up the skill-tree, we offer opportunities to contribute to the open source community and improve Fedora Linux usability, stability, and performance on the Raspberry Pi, alleviating some of the heavy burden placed on the small team of engineers responsible for this platform and providing the community with a better Fedora experience. We expose students to this community work as early as possible in the pipeline, feeding them bits of important information while giving them time to digest. We have built a network of engineers and maintainers within the Fedora and Raspberry Pi communities to provide guidance, mentorship, and projects for students to work on. This places students involved in the program in an advantageous position early in their careers in terms of their professional networks within open source communities, which is critical to Red Hat’s business success.</p>
<h3 id="linux-kernel-development-talent-cultivation">Linux Kernel Development Talent Cultivation</h3>
<p>Originating from a Fall 2019 Metro Boston RiG initiative, Red Hat offers an original “Introduction to Linux Kernel Engineering” course at the University of Massachusetts Lowell that was created, developed, and delivered by Red Hat associates and interns. This course has resulted in a growing handful of students interning at Red Hat, some of whom have even been hired as full time associates. Over each successive iteration of the course, we have had the delightful opportunity to observe the success of this program at its primary goal: increasing the number of software engineering candidates who have strong Linux kernel background knowledge and development skills. New hires coming out of this program require less onboarding time, saving the company time and money. As we continue to extend our course offerings to other institutions we will not only increase the diversity within the pool of qualified software engineering candidates, but we will provide a focused training program developed by experienced industry professionals that teaches skills rapidly disappearing from university curricula and provides a competitive edge to our students who would otherwise face a much heavier onboarding burden when they enter the technology industry.</p>
<p>Our front door for this program is a course titled &quot;Intro to Kernel Development&quot; that we are currently running for our third semester. It is offered as a small for-credit directed study course at UMass Lowell, with a couple of students from other universities. Our goal is to establish larger for-credit Special Topics college courses at UMass Lowell in the fall, as well as expanding to other colleges and integrating with Red Hat Academy&#39;s larger program. Red Hat has been supplying the students with the necessary equipment as well as hiring previous students as interns, who then have the opportunity to turn around and improve the course from the teaching side, as well as participate in teaching itself.</p>
<p>By the nature and design of the course, successful students will be able to demonstrate intern-level competency to an audience of their peers, Red Hat engineers, and even potential hiring managers. This exposure is an effective reputational credential, easing Red Hat’s internship hiring decisions and empowering interns from our program to rapidly onboard and deepen their skills in the industry environment, while exposing them to an expansive network of mentors and contacts. Due to their boosted internship experience, we believe the students are more likely to demonstrate entry-level associate competency by the end of their Red Hat tenure. The frequency at which we extend the students’ internships beyond their original period is evidence of our program’s success so far.</p>
<p>As interns or as students supported by Red Hat stipends, previous students of the course can fill the role of Teaching Assistants, working with Red Hat associates to iterate on curricula, mentor new students, and even deliver course lectures with some guidance. This enables student feedback and fresh experience to directly power the success of the current students by tapping into their unique insight they gained when they took the course.</p>
<p>Course topics include: drivers and modules, general Linux tips, character drivers, concurrency and race conditions, hardware interaction, interrupt handling, memory management, standard and advanced C tips, Direct Memory Access (DMA), big-picture kernel overview, system call interface, process internals, and more.</p>
<h3 id="fedora-on-raspberry-pi-intern-and-co-op-projects">Fedora on Raspberry Pi Intern and Co-op Projects</h3>
<p>As a leader among general-use Linux distributions, Fedora should be a top pick for users of the Raspberry Pi of all experience levels from new users to developers, and while there is some support for the platform, it is lacking in several ways—especially on the Raspberry Pi model 4B. The founding mission from which this entire program has evolved was initially trying to rectify this shortfall, and it still remains one of our primary objectives to this day. We work to improve the usability, stability, and performance of Fedora Linux on the Raspberry Pi platform by developing, improving and maintaining drivers, libraries, configuration tools and other software for the Raspberry Pi. We follow the Fedora policy of upstream first and aim to make our contributions available and useful to the broader open source community, especially in the mainline Linux Kernel. Anyone is welcome to join the project and contribute, as long as they are willing to publish their code for all to see. Our current projects include upstreaming the drivers for the peripheral add on boards developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation (namely the driver for their Sense HAT) as well as re-implementing the API of the popular RPi.GPIO library to work with Fedora’s most standard kernel interfaces, leveraging an existing general-purpose GPIO library called libgpiod. This library – which we call RPi.GPIO2 – is feature-complete and we are continuing to improve the software quality as we move through the final steps of the Fedora package submission process. We are also working to bring some of the userspace utilities to Fedora, such as raspi-config, that make configuring the Raspberry Pi in Raspbian easy and approachable.</p>
