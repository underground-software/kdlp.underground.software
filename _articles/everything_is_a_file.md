title: Everything is a file (in Linux)
---
This elegant design principle dates back to
the beginning of (Unix) time, a.k.a.
[the 70s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January 1, 1970).
However, this simple principle is an
oversimplification - consider the existence
of directories.
In reality, the slogan
["Everything is a file"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file)
is a convenient shorthand for the more accurate
but less catchy notion that (almost) all
resources available to a process on a
[Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like)
operating system can be referenced by a
[file descriptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor).
