# Lecture 6 - 28 September 2023

## Topics covered:

* P0 status
* continued: kernelspace vs userspace demo

###  P0 Status

We received 6 initial submissions by the initial P0 deadline and assigned peer reviews.

### Kernelspace vs userspace demo

We took another look at the demo we posted on [L05](L05.md) after class.

That demo can be found
[here](https://kdlp.underground.software/cgit/priv_rdmsr_demo/) and obtained by running:

    git clone https://kdlp.underground.software/cgit/priv_rdmsr_demo

Ensure that you are comfortable with some of the introductory details
we discussed in [L05](L05.md).

Recall from [L05](L05.md) that a trap is a type of CPU exception.

We browsed the source for the Linux implementation of trap handling to understand the codepath that executes when the user executes the "UD2" instruction and prints a message to the kernel ring buffer (`dmesg`).

Th address of the handler for this exception is defined  in
[arch/x86/kernel/traps.c](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5.5/source/arch/x86/kernel/traps.c), as
[`exc_invalid_op`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5.5/source/arch/x86/kernel/traps.c#L336).
Elsewhere, the corresponding row of the
[IDT](https://wiki.osdev.org/IDT)
is set to this address, so when the exception is generated,
[`handle_invalid_op`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5.5/source/arch/x86/kernel/traps.c#L292) is called.

If you are interested in the IDT then may also be interested in the
[GDT](https://wiki.osdev.org/GDT).

Linux implements a lot of x86-specific IDT related code in
[arch/x86/kernel/idt.c](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5.5/source/arch/x86/kernel/idt.c).

## Before next class

* Watch this video introducing [bpftrace](https://youtu.be/T2n1Eg76zCY)

* Get started on [E1](../assignments/E1.md) and check out this [completed demo](https://kdlp.underground.software/cgit/e1_demo/)

### Important Reminders

Initial submission for [E1](../assignments/E1.md) is due Tuesday 3 October 2023. We suggest that you get started early.
