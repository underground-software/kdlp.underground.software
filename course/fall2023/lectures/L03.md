# Lecture 3 - 19 September 2023

## Topics covered:

* Today is add drop date
* Continue syscall demo
* Live student submission review

### Today is add drop date

* Just a friendly reminder

### Continue Syscall Demo

* Charlie demonstrated several system calls needed to complete `P0`, with a focus on dealing with file descriptors

* Take note that the `struct stat` for a file contains a `mode` field that specifies file permissions

* Use the [`dup(2)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/dup.2.html) family to create unnamed pipes on your system

* When working with C strings in the kernel, we recommend passing around a pointer and a length pair rather than relying on null-termination

	* Once must take extra precaution to avoid buffer overflows in the kernel
	* While in userspace a buffer overflow is harmful, in the kernel it can be catastrophic to a system, and in a production environment, devastating to an organization

	* We will spend more time discussing security concerns later on

* Note that file descriptors are integers that index into a table of file descriptions.

* [`dup(2)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/dup.2.html) uses the file descriptor table to connect two file descriptors to each other.

* While `dup()` takes an fd to duplicate, `dup2()` takes a second existing fd to overwrite as the other end of the pipe.


### Live student submission review

* Be sure to submit all patches when you run `git send-email`

* Be sure to locally `git am` your patchset on a repo after running `git checkout -b test origin/master`. This will do the same thing that we will do to test your patchset.

* Be sure to include the DCO with your cover letter.

## Before next class

* Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/dcxi578qOvI) (25m) that gives a brief overview of the who why where and what of linux, and discusses some of the pieces that make up a functioning system and how they fit together.

* Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/qcue__Z2n6w) (25m) that explains and demonstrates some of the most common commands used on the commandline that you will want to be familiar with for the rest of the semester.
