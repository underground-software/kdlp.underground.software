# Lecture 4 - 21 September 2023

## Topics covered:

* Miscommunication regarding these notes
* Questions on P0
* Linux crash course and minimal distro

### A time saver for vim users

Append these two lines to your `~/.vimrc` to auto-highlight whitespace errors in your editor:

```
:highlight ExtraWhitespace ctermbg=red guibg=red
:match ExtraWhitespace /\s\+$/
```

### Miscommunication regarding these notes

* Reading through these lecture notes and following any instructions given there is essential for students to succeed in this course.
* We apologize for the lack of emphasis on this
* We did things a bit differently in the past
* As such, we will relax our expectations of what videos you have watched so far.
* If you have not done so, please go through all of [L0](L00.md), [L1](L01.md), [L2](L02.md), [L3](L03.md)
* We will announce lecture notes and any subsequent errata via the course matrix server
* In case anyone is having trouble finding a good client, try [element](https://element.io/). It's got mobile, web, and desktop apps.

### Questions on P0

* How do students make the commits while writing the code to later generate the patches?
	* Commit early and commit often when developing your shell
	* When in doubt about whether to commit, just do it
	* When your repo is in a state where your program builds and correctly implements stage `N`, make sure to make a commit and put a note about completing `N` in the log
	* Later, when you are preparing your work for submission, you will squash everything between these commits into single commits implementing a stage
	* Note that squash here is a technical term referring to the [`git-rebase`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) option
	* You will run `git format-patch ...` on the branch containing only these squashed commits
	* This is a great opportunity to practice `git rebase` 
* What functions can we use?
	* When P1 specifies a syscall for a scenario, you must use that
	* Beyond that, feel free to use anything provided by libc
* Do we need to check for memory leaks?
	* Yes
	* We will deduct credit from assignments for any memory leaks
	* Use [valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) to find the problems
	* Memory leaks are not as severe as build or runtime failures, which merit no credit
	* Try to fix these, but don't let this stop you from submitting if you are very close to the deadline

### Linux crash course and minimal distro

* We started with the [Linux Crash Course](https://kdlp.underground.software/slides/linux_crash_course.html) slide deck.
* First, we gave the general what, where, why, and who of Linux
	* Free and open source operating system kernel and ecosystem
	* Running on many systems large and small, fast and slow, distributed and centralized
	* Many pre-packaged combinations of system components capable of running user applications are available
	* We call one of these a Linux distribution, or distro for short.
	* Some examples are Fedora, Ubuntu, Arch Linux, RHEL, Puppy, and TAILS
* Having motivated our discussion of system components, we proceeded to discuss each one briefly
	* We quickly went through the bootloader, kernel, C standard library, shared libraries, storage configuration, and filesystem hierarchy layout
	* As we were about to proceed to the demo, we didn't go into great detail
	* Take note of the availability of manpages: run `man man` and read through the description.
* After finishing the slide deck, we build a minimal Linux distribution live
	* Using a ruthlessly minimal `.config` file, we built the kernel in noticably less time than it took to clone, even with the `--depth=1` option. Barely minutes.
	* Then, we tested this kernel with `qemu-system`, generating a kernel panic as expected
	* This is because the kernel attempts to start an inital userspace process and no such thing exists on the system
	* On many Linux systems, systemd is this first "init" process, and it is given PID `1`
	* We then created a root filesystem and a "hello world" init process
	* This native assembly simply prints hello world
	* Take note that the entry point is `_start` and not `main`
	* Normally this is hidden as `libc` does various init things between `_start` and the user-defined `main`
	* We used `strace` to see how our little app talks to the kernel
	* In order to pass the app binary into the kernel, we use `cpio` to create an archive usable as an inital ram disk for our system, which allows the kernel to run the app as an init process
	* This is generally refered to by the abbreviation `initrd`. 
	* `initrd` is an area of RAM that provides a storage device interface to the rest of the kernel.
* Since there were no questions, we attempted to make our minimal Linux distro interactive
	* We implemented a parameter allowing a user to specify a string to print after "hello" instead of "world"
	* The feature started working right in time for the end of class

## Before next class

* Make sure you have carefully read through [L0](L00.md), [L1](L01.md), [L2](L02.md), and [L3](L03.md]) and seen all the provided video content.
