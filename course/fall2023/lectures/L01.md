### C system programing interactive demo

0. the most basic C program possible: `main(){}`

1. hello world

2. What is a system call?
  
    * Synchronously ask Linux to do something for you as a user program

    * Student examples: open, read, write, close

    * Use these with file descriptors to do file I/O without `FILE *`

    * Use `man 2 xxx` to learn about system call `xxx`

3. Working with processes

    * [execve](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html): transform one process into another

    * [fork](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html): split one process in two

    * [wait](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/wait.2.html): wait for a child process

### tl;dr

** GET STARTED ON [P0](../assignments/P0.md) EARLY!! **
