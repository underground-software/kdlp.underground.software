# Lecture 5 - 26 September 2023

## Topics covered:

* Questions on P0
* kernelspace vs userspace

### Questions on P0

* To clarify, you are to submit the following email patch files:
    * Email patch file 0 is your cover letter
    * Patch 1 adds your Makefile, creating `p0/firstname_lastname/Makefile`
	* Each subsequent patch `N` implement step `N-2` listed on
		[P0](../assignments/P0.md). E.g, patch 5 implements step 3


### Kernelspace vs userspace

#### Fundamental difference: CPU privilege level at a given time

* On a Linux system, when the CPU is executing code in a fully privileged mode, we say that the CPU is executing the code in kernelspace

* On a Linux system, When the CPU is executing code at a restricted privilege level, we say that the CPU is executing the code in userspace

#### What does CPU privilege enable?
* Set behavior on [trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt#Terminology)
* Set behavior on [interrupt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt)
    * A quick explanation of [both](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3149175/what-is-the-difference-between-trap-and-interrupt)
* Set virtual-physical address mappings, i.e. configure [page tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_table)
* Execute privileged instructions
    * See [this table](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/) as an x86 instruction reference
    * We discussed [RDMSR](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/rdmsr) as an example
	* Unpriveleged execution of this instruction [raises](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/rdmsr#protected-mode-exceptions) the `#GP(0)` [CPU exception](https://wiki.osdev.org/Exceptions).
	* This is a [General Protection Exception](https://wiki.osdev.org/Exceptions#General_Protection_Fault)
	* There are three types of CPU exceptions: [faults](https://wiki.osdev.org/Exceptions#Faults),  [traps](https://wiki.osdev.org/Exceptions#Traps), and [aborts](https://wiki.osdev.org/Exceptions#Aborts).
	* The website linked in the previous bulled, wiki.osdev.org, has a huge about of information on this subject for the interested reader
* We experimented bit of assembly code to test out the exception handling codepaths of the Linux kernel.

#### Userspace Demo

Here's a short AT&T-style x86 assembly file we can use to generate a binary that will attempt to execute a privileged instruction:

```
global _start		; declare the _start symbol to have exernal linkage for visibility of linker
_start:				; the true entry point for an x86 executable program
	rdmsr			; execute the RDMSR instruction
```

Build the object file `rdmsr.o` from [`rdmsr.src`](https://kdlp.underground.software/cgit/priv_rdmsr_demo/tree/rdmsr.src) with:

`as -o rdmsr.o rdmsr.src`

Create the linked executable binary `rdmsr` from `rdmsr.o` with:

`ld -o rdmsr rdmsr.o`.

Invocation of this binary by `./rdmsr` should trigger a protection fault.

More information on the [`#UD` Invalid Opcode](https://wiki.osdev.org/Exceptions#Invalid_Opcode) exception.

#### Kernelspace Demo

With a small kernel module, we can get Linux to run the same instruction in kernelspace:

```
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/init.h>
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
static int priv_demo_init(void) {
                /* arbitrary poison values */
                int result_lower_32 = -0xAF, result_upper_32 = -0xBF;
                pr_info("EDX:EAX := MSR[ECX];");
                asm ( "rdmsr"
                : "=r" (result_upper_32), "=r" (result_lower_32) : : );
                pr_info("rdmsr: EDX=0x%x, EAX=0x%x\n",
                                result_lower_32, result_upper_32);
                return 0;
}
static void priv_demo_exit(void) {
                pr_info("rdmsr exiting");
}
module_init(priv_demo_init);
module_exit(priv_demo_exit)
```

We can build this with the same Makefile as shown [here on the E2 page](../assignments/E2.md).

#### Fully Automated demo

We created fully automated demo of privileged and unprivileged instruction execution.
To acquire and run this demo, enter your VM and run `git clone https://kdlp.underground.software/cgit/priv_rdmsr_demo/` and run `make` inside the directory.

## Before next class

* Read through the [E1](../assignments/E1.md) assignment page and check out this [completed demo](https://kdlp.underground.software/cgit/e1_demo/)
