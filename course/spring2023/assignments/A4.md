### A4 - Scavenger Hunt ðŸ”Ž

We will assign you a syscall and give you our specially designed program.

#### Outcomes:

* Learn basic Linux kernel tracing
* Get a basic understanding of BPF via `bpftrace`
* Strengthen understanding of the interaction between the kernel and userspace

#### Procedure:

1. Run `strace` on the provided program

	 * Locate the lines corresponding to call(s) to your syscall in the output and put them into assignment.md

2. Answer question 0 in assignment.md

	* Suggested: make use of the systemâ€™s manual pages

3. Find the syscall definition within the kernel source

	* Put the location into assignment.md

	* Suggested: make use of [elixir](https://elixir.bootlin.com/) or [cscope](http://cscope.sourceforge.net/)

4. Answer question 1 in the assignment.md file

	* Who last modified your syscallâ€™s code? What were they trying to do?

5. Write a `bpftrace` snippet to insert a probe that will print the syscall args and kernel stack in real time as the syscall is invoked

	* Ensure that the bpf probe is only triggered when our specific command is run

	* Suggested: [bpftrace/reference_guide.md at master](https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace/blob/master/docs/reference_guide.md#5-str-strings)

	* Hint: A script file must be marked as executable to be run

	* Hint: The first line of an executable `bpftrace` file must be "`#!/usr/bin/env bpftrace`"

6. Re-run the program with the bpf probe inserted via your `bpftrace` code

	* Save the results into assignment.md

7. Document your process in the cover letter as always


#### Tools of interest

* `strace`

* `man`

* `cscope`

* `git-blame`

* `git-grep [ -n ]`

* `bpftrace` and other BPF tooling

#### What to submit

* A cover letter following the assignment submission guidelines (as always)

* A patch which adds a directory named `firstname_lastname` to the A4 folder of the class repo with a copy of `assignment.md`.

* A patch that includes your changes to `assignment.md`

* A patch that includes the new entries in log.txt from all the times you ran the program

* A patch that includes two full logs from strace from running the program. Once as your regular user and once as running as root using `sudo`. Make sure you label which is which

* A patch that adds your `*.bp` `bpftrace` program
