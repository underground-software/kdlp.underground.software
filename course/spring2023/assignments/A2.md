### A2 - The Big Upgrade 🎢

Build, install, and boot the latest Linux kernel fresh off Linus Torvalds’ tree.

#### Outcomes:
* Set up a kernel development environment.
* Get comfortable with building the kernel.

#### Procedure:
* Get access to a Linux system on which you have root permissions.


* Install dependencies:
  * On Fedora, you can use:
    	`sudo dnf builddep kernel`
  * This roughly equivalent to:

	`sudo dnf -y install gcc flex make bison openssl openssl-devel elfutils-libelf-devel ncurses-devel bc git tar dwarves`

* Install ccache to speed up subsequent kernel builds:

	`sudo dnf -y install ccache`

  *Be sure to restart your terminal after installing ccache so that it gets added to your path*

* Clone the latest Linux kernel: <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git>.
* Compile the kernel with a custom version tag. 

        # clone the kernel tree

        git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git

        # change the current directory to the kernel tree

        cd linux

        # change the current directory to the kernel tree

        cp /boot/config-$(uname -r)* .config

        # set any new config options to the defaults

        make olddefconfig

        # to add label to the new kernel version string,

        # edit ‘Makefile” and add something cool to the ‘EXTRAVERSION’ variable

        # you can print the new version string to test it by:

        make kernelversion

        # build the kernel

        # -j species the number of threads

        # nproc finds the correct number for your machine

        make -j $(nproc)

        # install the modules

        # you need to be root for this step so use sudo

        sudo make modules_install -j $(nproc)

        # install the new kernel

        sudo make install

        # reboot – hopefully the new kernel is set as the default :)

        reboot

        ...

        uname -a

        dmesg | head

        whoami
* Seems easy enough right? 😉
* Expect the compilation to take a little while Make sure you have 5-10 GB of free space on the partition where you are storing the kernel tree and a bit of extra space on whatever partition /boot resides in to store the new kernel image and initramfs.

#### What to submit:

* The output of `uname -a` and `dmesg | head` and `whoami` on the system running your newly compiled Linux kernel. Make a copy of `template.md` in the assignment directory renamed to `firstname_lastname.md` and submit it as a patch.

* Don’t forget a cover letter.
